- Alternate UI test path:
  - Overall: this alternate path tests more features that is not in the happy path, includes create a listing using JSON file, upload video thumbnail, accept booking and rate a booked listing. This test uses two users to complete the action of booking and accept (e.g. the main user books the listing -> the helper user accept its booking -> the main user rates that listing)
